# P6 — `ai_query` → GPU serving endpoint (architecture)

**Caller compute:** Serverless Spark CPU (only needs `Pillow` for annotate)
**Inference compute:** GPU serving endpoint `bench-vit-serving` (GPU_SMALL), backed by
`models:/{catalog}.{schema}.bench_vit_serving@prod` — a pyfunc that takes a base64 `image`
string and returns `{label, score}`. **The endpoint does inference only** (no Volume I/O).
Deploy it once in `00_setup_register_model.py`.

**Why it's shaped this way:** inference is offloaded to a **reusable, governed** endpoint
callable from SQL (`ai_query`). The CPU job does base64 encoding, the `ai_query` fan-out,
and distributed annotate+writes — keeping all Volume I/O out of the endpoint. Base64 is
counted as part of end-to-end time (it's the serialization tax of crossing the endpoint
boundary). `ai_query` auto-retries 429s; validate on output completeness + correctness,
not on 429 count (retried 429s are invisible in the output table).

**Trade-off:** most infra to stand up (pyfunc wrapper + signature + endpoint), and costs
two compute resources at once (CPU job + GPU endpoint, though scale-to-zero limits idle
cost). Unique win: the endpoint is shared/versioned and usable from any SQL outside this
job. The `ai_query` phase is sensitive to per-image round-trips — it nearly doubled
(104s → 195s) on Imagenette's smaller files.

**Correctness:** endpoint vs P3 direct inference match **99.95%** (2/3,925 borderline
argmax flips from GPU fp16 vs CPU fp32).

**Timing (3,925 imgs, cold, script wall):** COCO **374s** · Imagenette **441s**.
